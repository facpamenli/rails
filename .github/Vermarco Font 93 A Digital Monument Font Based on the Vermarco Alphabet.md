Vermarco font 93 is a digital font based on the Vermarco alphabet, a popular lettering style for sandblasting monuments and headstones. Vermarco stands for Vermont Marble Company, the original creator of the alphabet in the late 1930s. The font is also known as Cutrite Vermarco, as it was inherited by the PMD Company from the Allied Industrial Sales Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy in the mid 1970s[^1^].
  
Vermarco font 93 is a condensed and bold version of the original Vermarco, with some unique features such as a notched '1', a double circle '8', and a zero with straight sides instead of an oval shape. It also includes alternate rounded 'E' and 'F' characters, which were first contained in the Spacerite Vermarco[^1^]. The font is available in both OpenType and TrueType formats, and can be used for creating digital designs or cutting stencils for sandblasting.

Once you have created your design using Vermarco font 93, you can print it on a special paper and transfer it to a rubber stencil. The stencil is then applied to the surface of the monument, which can be made of granite, marble, or other durable materials. The stencil will protect the areas that you want to keep polished, while exposing the areas that you want to engrave.
  
To sandblast the monument, you need to have a sandblasting machine, a compressor, a hose, and a nozzle. The sandblasting machine is filled with abrasive material, such as sand, glass beads, or steel grit. The compressor provides pressurized air to the machine, which propels the abrasive material at high speeds through the hose and the nozzle.
  
You need to wear protective gear, such as gloves, goggles, and a mask, before you start sandblasting. You also need to work in a well-ventilated area or a sandblasting booth. You can then aim the nozzle at the exposed areas of the monument and move it back and forth until you achieve the desired depth and contrast. The abrasive material will remove the polished layer of the monument and create a rough texture that contrasts with the smooth background.
  
After sandblasting, you need to remove the stencil and clean the monument with water and a brush. You can also add some finishing touches by hand using special tools, such as chisels or hammers. You can then admire your work and enjoy the beauty of Vermarco font 93 on your monument.
