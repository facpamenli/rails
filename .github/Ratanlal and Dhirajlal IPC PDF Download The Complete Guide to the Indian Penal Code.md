The Indian Penal Code, 1860 is the main criminal code of India. It was enacted by the British colonial government to consolidate and codify the criminal law of India. It covers a wide range of offences, such as murder, rape, theft, cheating, forgery, rioting, sedition, terrorism and more. It also defines the general principles of criminal liability, such as mens rea, actus reus, joint liability, vicarious liability and exceptions.
 
The Indian Penal Code, 1860 has been amended several times since its inception. Some of the major amendments include the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, which introduced harsher punishments for sexual offences and added new offences such as acid attack, voyeurism and stalking; the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018, which increased the minimum age of consent from 16 to 18 years and prescribed death penalty for rape of children below 12 years; and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act, 2019, which empowered the central government to designate individuals as terrorists and seize their properties.
 
The Indian Penal Code, 1860 is not applicable to the whole of India. It does not extend to the state of Jammu and Kashmir (now a union territory), which has its own criminal code called the Ranbir Penal Code. It also does not apply to certain tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura, which are governed by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Moreover, some offences under the IPC are subject to special laws, such as the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958; the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988; and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
